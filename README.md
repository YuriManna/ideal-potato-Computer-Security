TODO:
Testing and Verification
- Multiple Clients: You can create additional configuration files with different client IDs and run multiple clients simultaneously to test concurrent connections.
- Server Logs: Check server.log to verify that actions are being logged correctly, implement different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Error Handling: Test scenarios like incorrect passwords, invalid actions, and multiple logins.
- Password Storage: Passwords are stored in plain text in this example. For enhanced security, consider hashing passwords using a secure algorithm!!!
- Input validation
- Implement Certificate Authority
- Research security vulnerability in the whole code
